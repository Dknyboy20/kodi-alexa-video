# Kodi Alexa Video Skill

Implements [Alexa Video Skill](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/video/understand-the-video-skill-api.html)
Example [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTgooV_YEvg)

Connects to the Kodi Connect Server to:
 - Discover all registered Kodi instances

## Beta testing
At the moment, the skill is not certified, and is in Beta testing, so you have to contact me, in order to be included in.

Also note, that Amazon has made Video Skills available only to US, UK, and DE countries. So you will have to switch country in Amazon settings in order to be able to use this skill.
